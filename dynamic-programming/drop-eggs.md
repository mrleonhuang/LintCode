## 254. Drop Eggs \[LintCode\]

> There is a building of`n`floors. If an egg drops from the\_k\_th floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break.
>
> You're given two eggs, Find\_k\_while minimize the number of drops for the worst case. Return the number of drops in the worst case.  
> **Clarification**
>
> For n = 10, a naive way to find\_k\_is drop egg from 1st floor, 2nd floor ... kth floor. But in this worst case \(k = 10\), you have to drop 10 times.
>
> Notice that you have two eggs, so you can drop at 4th, 7th & 9th floor, in the worst case \(for example, k = 9\) you have to drop 4 times.
>
> **Example**
>
> Given n =`10`, return`4`.  
> Given n =`100`, return `14`.
