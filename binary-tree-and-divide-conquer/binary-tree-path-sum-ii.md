# 246. Binary Tree Path Sum II

> Your are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design an algorithm to get all paths which sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go in a straight line down.
>
> **Example**
>
> Given a binary tree:

> ```
>     1
>    / \
>   2   3
>  /   /
> 4   2

> ```
>
> for target =`6`, return

> [
>   [2, 4],
>   [1, 3, 2]
